		<td><h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
		<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>Education Management Information 
		 System (EMIS)</i></span> is a web-based monitoring, evaluation, and 
		 communication system that has been developed under the auspices 
		 of the USAID Partnership for Education: Evaluating Systems, a 
		 five-year project in support of and in collaboration with the 
		 Ministry of Education (MOE) of the Government of Ghana and the 
		 Ghana Education Service (GES). The system is designed as part 
		 of the USAID's commitment to assess, analyse, recommend, and roll 
		 out an improved <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>EMIS</i></span> 
		 for MOE-GES to promote effective and harmonized M&amp;E practices.</p>
		<p>&#160;</p>
		<p><span style="font-style: italic;"><i>EMIS</i></span> aims at streamlining 
		 the current business processes within the Ministry of Education 
		 and providing a unified platform for school census data collection, 
		 data analysis, and sharing. Moreover, the system serves as the 
		 main information hub for all school census data and provides remote 
		 access to the data to all the stakeholders and other interested 
		 parties involved in the process of shaping education strategies 
		 in Ghana.</p>
		<p>&#160;</p>
		<p>The main objective of <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>EMIS</i></span> 
		 is to improve the school census data collection and analysis processes. 
		 In addition to this, the system is intended for improving and 
		 automating the business processes of all units within MOE â€“ GES, 
		 from the school to the national level, and enhancing data sharing 
		 among them. With <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>EMIS</i></span>, 
		 MOE-GES administration has the ability of monitoring the efficiency 
		 of the census data collection process, performing indicator analysis 
		 for the current and previous years, and building projections for 
		 the future. Another distinct feature of the system that the MOE-GES 
		 users can take advantage of is the ability to track performance 
		 standards and compliance with the government regulations, thus, 
		 increasing accountability and public confidence in the education 
		 sector of Ghana.</p>
		<p>&#160;</p>
		<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>School Census</i></span> module 
		 in <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>EMIS</i></span> provides a convenient 
		 and easy way of collecting and updating school census data on 
		 the annual basis and submit them for review at the district and 
		 regional offices and divisions. Once you have accessed this module, 
		 you are able to add new and modify existing school census records, 
		 as well as keep track of the changes made to them. Moreover, the 
		 <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>School Census</i></span> module 
		 is incorporated with a built-in online data entry sub-system designed 
		 to allow entering the school censuses related data remotely via 
		 the Internet.</p>
